🫀 Heart Disease Prediction Model
This project applies machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease using the widely-known Cleveland dataset from the UCI repository. The workflow in your notebook includes:

Data preprocessing: cleaning, encoding, and scaling 14 essential features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, ECG data, chest pain type, and more.

Model training: comparing several classifiers—Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and XGBoost—to identify the best-performing model.

Model selection: selecting the top model based on accuracy and performance metrics (e.g., ROC-AUC).

Prediction & evaluation: applying the chosen model to real patient data to assess disease risk.

💡 Real‑World Applications:

🚑 Early Detection: Helps medical professionals identify at‑risk patients early for timely intervention.

🩺 Clinical Aid: Enhances diagnostic accuracy by serving as a supportive decision‑making tool.

📱 Digital Health Integration: Can be integrated into health apps, telemedicine platforms, or wearable devices to offer instant risk insights.

🌍 Public Health Impact: Enables large-scale screenings, particularly valuable in rural or resource-limited settings, improving preventive care.

🚀 Significance: The model demonstrates how thoughtful feature engineering and comparative algorithm selection can make ML both robust and interpretable—perfect for real healthcare use.
